I am
a [Ph.D. candidate](https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/persons/xiaoyuan-zhang(6672c5c3-987f-4d60-9a38-e0ce376b9803).html)
at the Department of Computer Science, [CityUHK](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/).
I will graduate in **April 2025** under the supervision
of [Chair Prof. Zhang Qingfu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nhL9PHwAAAAJ&hl=en) (IEEE Fellow).
Before joining CityUHK, I received my B.E. (2017) and M.E. (2020) degrees
from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/en/), where I was advised
by [Prof. Qi Chenkun](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37529382400).
I have also been fortunate to maintain long-term collaborations
with [Prof. Yang Yaodong](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=6yL0xw8AAAAJ&hl=en)
at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/)
and [Prof. Han Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x942ipYAAAAJ&hl=en) at
the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/).

I focus on **_the theory, software implementation, and engineering applications of multi-objective optimization_**. 
I have made many **theoretical advances** in Pareto set learning and developed [LibMOON](https://github.com/xzhang2523/libmoon), the first open-source, gradient-based library for large-scale multi-objective optimization. 
Collaborating with the team from PKU, I applied this technique to train large language models (**LLMs**) with tens of billions of parameters, with results published at **NeurIPS 2024**.

**I will graduate in the spring of 2025 and am currently on the job market ([CV](https://xzhang2523.github.io/assets/pdf/cv/english.pdf), [中文简历]((https://xzhang2523.github.io/assets/pdf/cv/chinese.pdf))).**
