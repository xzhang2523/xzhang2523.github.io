I am set to graduate in **April 2025** from the Department of Computer Science at CityHK, where I have been pursuing my PhD under the supervision of [Chair Prof. Zhang Qingfu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nhL9PHwAAAAJ&hl=en) (IEEE Fellow). 
Before joining CityU, I earned my B.E. (2017) and M.E. (2020) degrees in Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I was advised by [Prof. Qi Chenkun](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37529382400). 
I have also been fortunate to maintain long-term collaborations with [Prof. Yang Yaodong](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=6yL0xw8AAAAJ&hl=en)'s team at Peking University and [Prof. Han Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x942ipYAAAAJ&hl=en)'s team at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

My research primarily focuses on the theory, software implementation, and engineering applications of multi-objective optimization. 
I developed [LibMOON](https://github.com/xzhang2523/libmoon), the industry's first open-source, gradient-based multi-objective optimization library, designed to efficiently solve large-scale problems involving millions of parameters. 
My work has been invited for presentation at various conferences and was published at the prestigious NeurIPS 2024. 
In addition to these contributions, I have made significant theoretical advances in Pareto set learning and, in collaboration with the team from Peking University, was the first to apply this learning technique to large-scale model training with tens of billions of parameters, with these results also published at NeurIPS 2024.
